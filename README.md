# ðŸ”‹ Battery Management Studio Data Plotter

**Author:** Gonzalo Patino

This application processes `.log` files generated by **Battery Management Studio** and transforms them into visual plots for battery characterization analysis. It provides insights into key metrics like voltage, current, and temperature over time, enabling better understanding of battery performance.

## ðŸ“‹ Problem Statement

Analyzing battery data directly from `.log` files can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Battery engineers often need clear visual representations of voltage, current, and temperature to make informed decisions. Manual conversion of this data into plots takes time and introduces the risk of errors.

## ðŸŒŸ Solution Overview

The **Battery Management Studio Data Plotter** automates the process of visualizing battery data. Users upload `.log` files from **Battery Management Studio**, and the application instantly generates clear plots displaying:
- **Voltage (mV) over time**
- **Current (mA) over time**
- **Temperature (Â°C) over time**

This eliminates manual work and provides immediate, actionable insights into battery behavior during different test phases, including charging and discharging.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Automatic Plot Generation**: Instantly generates plots for voltage, current, and temperature from uploaded `.log` files.
- **Visual Markers**: Highlights key points on the plots for easier analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple GUI allows users to upload files and generate plots with one click.
- **Error Handling**: Detects issues in log file formatting and handles them gracefully.
- **Efficient Data Processing**: Saves time and reduces errors in interpreting battery data.
- **Save the output file**: Choose your preferred output file format.
